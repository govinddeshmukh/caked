Delivery costs<br/> will apply and will depend on travel time. Local set up charges are £40 for 5 miles within Shaftesbury, Dorset. Further venues will be quoted for you. Delivery costs include<br/> delivery and set-up, as well as liaising with your venue, florist, etc so that you have nothing to worry about on the day.
